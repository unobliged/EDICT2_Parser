EDICT2 Parser
=============
This is a ruby script to extract information in a semi-structured format from the EDICT2 japanese dictionary. This dictionary is made possible by the Electronic Dictionary Research and Development Group (EDRDG) and is based off the work of Jim Breen and the EDICT project he started. More functionality will be added over time and updates will be posted here. JMDict parsing will be a separate project. This code is available freely (MIT License), though the information sources employed will require attribution.
